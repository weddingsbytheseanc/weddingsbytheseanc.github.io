A Fabulous Wedding Awaits You

At Weddings By the Sea, our ultimate goal is to give you the wedding you've always dreamed of. A wedding that reflects your unique personality and style. A wedding that you and your guests will be talking about long after the ceremony has ended.

It's your day and you should enjoy it!

Your engagement is a special time that you should enjoy to the fullest. Don't spend it stressing out about your wedding details. Let Weddings By the Sea take care of this for you! We have several packages for you to choose from. We offer several packages, but we believe that your wedding day is YOUR day, so please let us know if you would like to alter any package. We will gladly discuss all your ideas at length, then design a plan with a variety of options for you to consider. When you give us the go-ahead, we'll make it all happen, keeping you updated regularly, of course. You can just sit back and sample cake, taste champagne, and smell the roses!

Our prices are very affordable

With our extensive industry experience and contacts, we are uniquely positioned to create your memorable day for much less cost than you might expect. We'll manage your entire wedding - or just certain elements of it. It's up to you.
